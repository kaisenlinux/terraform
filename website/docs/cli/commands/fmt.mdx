# Command: fmt

The `terraform fmt` command is used to rewrite Terraform configuration files
to a canonical format and style. This command applies a subset of
the [Terraform language style conventions](/terraform/language/style#code-formatting),
along with other minor adjustments for readability.

Other Terraform commands that generate Terraform configuration will produce
configuration files that conform to the style imposed by `terraform fmt`, so
using this style in your own files will ensure consistency.

The canonical format may change in minor ways between Terraform versions, so
after upgrading Terraform we recommend to proactively run `terraform fmt`
on your modules along with any other changes you are making to adopt the new
version.

We don't consider new formatting rules in `terraform fmt` to be a breaking
change in new versions of Terraform, but we do aim to minimize changes for
configurations that are already following the style examples shown in the
Terraform documentation. When adding new formatting rules, they will usually
aim to apply more of the rules already shown in the configuration examples
in the documentation, and so we recommend following the documented style even
for decisions that `terraform fmt` doesn't yet apply automatically.

Formatting decisions are always subjective and so you might disagree with the
decisions that `terraform fmt` makes. This command is intentionally opinionated
and has no customization options because its primary goal is to encourage
consistency of style between different Terraform codebases, even though the
chosen style can never be everyone's favorite.

We recommend that you follow the style conventions applied by `terraform fmt`
when writing Terraform modules, but if you find the results particularly
objectionable then you may choose not to use this command, and possibly choose
to use a third-party formatting tool instead. If you choose to use a
third-party tool then you should also run it on files that are generated
automatically by Terraform, to get consistency between your hand-written files
and the generated files.

## Usage

Usage: `terraform fmt [options] [target...]`

By default, the `terraform fmt` command scans your current directory for configuration files. You can also provide a `target` argument to tell `terraform fmt` to scan:
* A directory 
* A specific file
* Standard input by supplying a single dash (`-`).

The `terraform fmt` command accepts the following arguments.

| Flag | Description | Required |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| `-list=false` | Prevents the command from listing the files containing formatting inconsistencies. | Optional |
| `-diff` | Displays the diffs of formatting changes. | Optional |
| `-write=false` | Prevents the command from overwriting files. This behavior is implied by the `-check` flag or if the input is from `STDIN`. | Optional |
| `-check` | Checks if the input is formatted. The exit status is `0` if the command's input is properly formatted. Otherwise, the exit status is non-zero, and the command outputs a list of improperly formatted file names. | Optional |
| `-recursive` | Processes files in subdirectories in addition to the current directory. By default, the command only processes the specified, or current, directory. | Optional |
