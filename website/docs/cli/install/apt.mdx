# APT Packages for Debian and Ubuntu

The primary distribution packages for Terraform are `.zip` archives containing
single executable files that you can extract anywhere on your system. However,
for easier integration with configuration management tools and other systematic
system configuration strategies, we also offer package repositories for
Debian and Ubuntu systems, which allow you to install Terraform using the
`apt install` command or any other APT frontend.

If you are instead using Red Hat Enterprise Linux, CentOS, or Fedora, you
might prefer to [install Terraform from our Yum repositories](/cli/install/yum).

-> **Note:** The APT repositories discussed on this page are generic HashiCorp
repositories that contain packages for a variety of different HashiCorp
products, rather than just Terraform. Adding these repositories to your
system will, by default, therefore make several other non-Terraform
packages available for installation. That might then mask some packages that
are available for some HashiCorp products in the main Debian and Ubuntu
package repositories.

## Repository Configuration

The Terraform packages are signed using a private key controlled by HashiCorp, so you must configure your system to trust that HashiCorp key for package authentication.

To configure your repository:

1. Download the signing key to a new keyring.

   ```bash
   $ wget -O- https://apt.releases.hashicorp.com/gpg | \
       gpg --dearmor | \
       sudo tee /usr/share/keyrings/hashicorp-archive-keyring.gpg

1. Verify the key's fingerprint.

   ```bash
   $ gpg --no-default-keyring \
       --keyring /usr/share/keyrings/hashicorp-archive-keyring.gpg \
       --fingerprint
   ```
   The fingerprint must match `E8A0 32E0 94D8 EB4E A189 D270 DA41 8C88 A321 9F7B`. You can also verify the key on [Security at HashiCorp](https://www.hashicorp.com/security) under **Linux Package Checksum Verification**.

1. Add the official HashiCorp repository to your system. The `lsb_release -cs` command finds the distribution release codename for your current system, such as `buster`, `groovy`, or `sid`.

   ```bash
   $ echo "deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/hashicorp-archive-keyring.gpg] \
       https://apt.releases.hashicorp.com $(lsb_release -cs) main" | \
       sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/hashicorp.list
   ```

1. Download the package information from HashiCorp.

  ```bash
  $ sudo apt update
  ```

1. Install Terraform from the new repository.

   ```bash
   $ sudo apt install terraform
   ```

## Supported Architectures

The HashiCorp APT server has packages only for the `amd64`
architecture, which is also sometimes known as `x86_64`.

There are no official packages available for other architectures, such as
`arm64`. If you wish to use Terraform on a non-`amd64` system,
[download a normal release `.zip` file](/downloads) instead.

## Supported Debian and Ubuntu Releases

The HashiCorp APT server contains release repositories for the
following distribution releases:

* Debian 9 (`stretch`)
* Debian 10 (`buster`)
* Debian 11 (`bullseye`)
* Ubuntu 16.04 (`xenial`)
* Ubuntu 18.04 (`bionic`)
* Ubuntu 19.10 (`eoam`)
* Ubuntu 20.04 (`focal`)
* Ubuntu 20.10 (`groovy`)
* Ubuntu 21.04 (`hirsute`)
* Ubuntu 21.10 (`impish`)

No repositories are available for other Debian or Ubuntu versions or
any other APT-based Linux distributions. If you add the repository using
the above commands on other systems then `apt update` will report the
repository index as missing.

Terraform executables are statically linked and so they depend only on the
Linux system call interface, not on any system libraries. Because of that,
you may be able to use one of the above release codenames when adding a
repository to your system, even if that codename doesn't match your current
distribution release.

Over time we will change the set of supported distributions, including both
adding support for new releases and ceasing to publish new Terraform versions
under older releases.

## Choosing Terraform Versions

The HashiCorp APT repositories contain multiple versions of Terraform, but
because the packages are all named `terraform` it is impossible to install
more than one version at a time, and `apt install` will default to selecting
the latest version.

It's often necessary to match your Terraform version with what a particular
configuration is currently expecting. You can use the following command to
see which versions are currently available in the repository index:

```bash
apt policy terraform
```

There may be multiple package releases for a particular Terraform version if
we need to publish an updated package for any reason. In that case, the
subsequent releases will have an additional suffix, like `0.13.4-2`. In these
cases, the Terraform executable inside the package should be unchanged, but its
metadata and other contents may be different.

You can select a specific version to install by including it in the
`apt install` command line, as follows:

```bash
sudo apt install terraform=0.14.0
```

If your workflow requires using multiple versions of Terraform at the same
time, for example when working through a gradual upgrade where not all
of your configurations are upgraded yet, we recommend that you use the
official release `.zip` files instead of the APT packages, so you can install
multiple versions at once and then select which to use for each command you
run.
