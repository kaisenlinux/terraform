# HCP Terraform Configuration

The main module of a Terraform configuration can integrate with HCP Terraform to enable its [CLI-driven run workflow](/terraform/cloud-docs/run/cli). You only need to configure these settings when you want to use Terraform CLI to interact with HCP Terraform. HCP Terraform ignores them when interacting with
Terraform through version control or the API.

> **Hands On:** Try the [Migrate State to HCP Terraform](/terraform/tutorials/cloud/cloud-migrate) tutorial.

## Usage Example

To configure the HCP Terraform CLI integration, add a nested `cloud` block within the `terraform` block. You cannot use the CLI integration and a [state backend](/terraform/language/settings/backends/configuration) in the same configuration.

Refer to [Using HCP Terraform](/terraform/cli/cloud) in the Terraform CLI documentation for full configuration details, migration instructions, and command line arguments.

```hcl
terraform {
  cloud {
    organization = "example_corp"
    ## Required for Terraform Enterprise; Defaults to app.terraform.io for HCP Terraform
    hostname = "app.terraform.io"

    workspaces {
      tags = ["app"]
    }
  }
}
```
