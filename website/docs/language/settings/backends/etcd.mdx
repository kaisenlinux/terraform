# etcd (deprecated)

-> **Note:** The `etcd` backend is deprecated and will be removed in a future Terraform release.

Stores the state in [etcd 2.x](https://coreos.com/etcd/docs/latest/v2/README.html) at a given path.

This backend does **not** support [state locking](/language/state/locking).

## Example Configuration

```hcl
terraform {
  backend "etcd" {
    path      = "path/to/terraform.tfstate"
    endpoints = "http://one:4001 http://two:4001"
  }
}
```

## Data Source Configuration

```hcl
data "terraform_remote_state" "foo" {
  backend = "etcd"
  config = {
    path      = "path/to/terraform.tfstate"
    endpoints = "http://one:4001 http://two:4001"
  }
}
```

## Configuration Variables

!> **Warning:**  We recommend using environment variables to supply credentials and other sensitive data. If you use `-backend-config` or hardcode these values directly in your configuration, Terraform will include these values in both the `.terraform` subdirectory and in plan files. Refer to [Credentials and Sensitive Data](/language/settings/backends/configuration#credentials-and-sensitive-data) for details.

The following configuration options are supported:

- `path` - (Required) The path where to store the state
- `endpoints` - (Required) A space-separated list of the etcd endpoints
- `username` - (Optional) The username
- `password` - (Optional) The password
