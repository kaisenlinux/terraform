# `filebase64sha512` Function

`filebase64sha512` is a variant of [`base64sha512`](./base64sha512.html)
that hashes the contents of a given file rather than a literal string.

This is similar to `base64sha512(file(filename))`, but
because [`file`](./file.html) accepts only UTF-8 text it cannot be used to
create hashes for binary files.
