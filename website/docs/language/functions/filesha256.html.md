# `filesha256` Function

`filesha256` is a variant of [`sha256`](./sha256.html)
that hashes the contents of a given file rather than a literal string.

This is similar to `sha256(file(filename))`, but
because [`file`](./file.html) accepts only UTF-8 text it cannot be used to
create hashes for binary files.
