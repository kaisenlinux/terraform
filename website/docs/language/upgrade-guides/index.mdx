# Upgrading to Terraform v1.9

-> **Tip:** Use the version selector to view the upgrade guides for older Terraform versions.

Terraform v1.9 is a minor release in the stable Terraform v1.0 series.

Terraform v1.9 honors the
[Terraform v1.0 Compatibility Promises](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/v1-compatibility-promises),
but there are two changes that may require additional upgrade steps:

- `.tftest.hcl` files no longer support the `version` attribute in the `provider` block.
- `import` blocks will now report an error if the `to` attribute points to a module that does not exist.

See [the full changelog](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/blob/v1.9/CHANGELOG.md)
for more details. If you encounter any problems during upgrading which are not
covered this guide, please start a new topic in
[the Terraform community forum](https://discuss.hashicorp.com/c/terraform-core)
to discuss it.

## Provider constraints in `.tftest.hcl` files

In Terraform v1.9, the `version` attribute has been removed from the `provider`
block in the `.tftest.hcl` files. Terraform test files are not meant to be used
to specify provider versions, so this attribute has been removed to reflect the
intent of the test files.

If you are using the `version` attribute in the `provider` block in your test
files, you will need to remove it before running `terraform test` with Terraform
v1.9. Instead, you should update the `required_providers` block in your main
configuration to specify the provider version constraints.


## Invalid `import` blocks

In Terraform v1.9, the `import` block will now report an error if the `to`
attribute points to a module that does not exist. Previously, Terraform would
silently ignore these `import` blocks.

If you have `import` blocks that reference a module that does not exist, you
will need to update your configuration to remove or correct them.
