// dependenclyLockFilename is the filename of the dependency lock file.

// This file should live in the same directory as the .tf files for the
// root module of the configuration, alongside the .terraform directory
// as long as that directory's path isn't overridden by the TF_DATA_DIR
// environment variable.
//
// We always expect to find this file in the current working directory
// because that should also be the root module directory.
//
// Some commands have legacy command line arguments that make the root module
// directory something other than the root module directory; when using those,
// the lock file will be written in the "wrong" place (the current working
// directory instead of the root module directory) but we do that intentionally
// to match where the ".terraform" directory would also be written in that
// case. Eventually we will phase out those legacy arguments in favor of the
// global -chdir=... option, which _does_ preserve the intended invariant
// that the root module directory is always the current working directory.

// in which the lock file is invalid.
