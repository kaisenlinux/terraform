# terraform-bundle

terraform-bundle is no longer actively maintained. We recommend that you switch
to one of the [alternative provider installation methods](https://www.terraform.io/docs/cli/config/config-file.html#provider-installation)
introduced in Terraform v0.13. To continue using terraform-bundle, you can build
terraform-bundle from the v0.15 branch of the terraform repository.
