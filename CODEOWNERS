# go.sum files should never cause automatic review requests because they only
# ever change in response to go.mod files (our PR checks would fail if not) and
# if a specific module has _only_ a go.sum update without an associated go.mod
# update then that represents that the update cannot affect the module, and
# the Go toolchain just needed to download something new to prove that.
#
# (The last match in the file "wins", so this overrides any explicit owner
# specified above when go.sum is the only file that changed.)
*/go.sum   # no owner for these
